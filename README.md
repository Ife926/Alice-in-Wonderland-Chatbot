Alice Chatbot

## Overview
The **Alice in Wonderland Chatbot** is an AI-powered chatbot designed to engage users in interactive conversations inspired by Lewis Carroll's *Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland*. The chatbot leverages **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning (ML)** to provide intelligent, context-aware responses. This project includes the development, training, and deployment of the chatbot for real-world interaction.

## Features
- **Conversational AI**: Engages users with context-aware and dynamic responses.
- **Pre-trained & Custom NLP Models**: Utilizes advanced NLP techniques to understand and respond to queries.
- **Character-Based Interaction**: The chatbot embodies the whimsical nature of Wonderland characters.
- **Web & API Deployment**: Hosted online for seamless access and integration.
- **Multi-turn Dialog Management**: Maintains conversational context across multiple exchanges.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** – Core language for development
- **NLTK & SpaCy** – Text processing and NLP techniques
- **TensorFlow & PyTorch** – Machine learning model training
- **Flask/FastAPI** – Backend API for chatbot interaction
- **HTML, CSS & JavaScript** – Frontend for chatbot interface
- **Docker** – Containerization for easy deployment
- **Cloud Deployment (AWS/GCP)** – Hosting the chatbot online

## Dataset
The chatbot was trained using:
